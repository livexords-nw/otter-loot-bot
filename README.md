## üåü **Version v1.0.1**

### üîÑ **Updates**
- **Bug Fix:** Improved the logic for the steal feature to handle the following:
  - Stops attempts if the error is related to request limits.
  - Continues retrying if the error is related to the target.
  - Avoids reusing positions that have already been attempted.
- Enhanced randomization for steal positions, now ranging from 1 to 10.
- Added a maximum error limit to prevent infinite loops during failed attempts.

### üêõ **Bug Fix Details**
- Fixed an issue where the steal process would retry the same positions multiple times.
- Resolved a problem where the steal process did not properly handle error responses from the server, leading to unintended behaviors.
- Optimized error handling for better user feedback and smoother execution.
